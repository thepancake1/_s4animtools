# _s4animtools

S4AnimTools is a toolset for making animations and poses for The Sims 4. Made in mind with Blender 3.0, but may work on versions 2.8 and above.

Check out the installation guide and tutorials here!

I used the following resources to help build this tool:

[Sims 3 Clip Info File Structure](http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:0x6B20C4F3)

[Sims 4 Clip Binary Template](https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/872672/clip-resource-0x6b20c4f3-v14)

Thanks to everybody who contributed to these resources, as well as everybody who helped test the tools!
