# _s4animtools

S4AnimTools is a toolset for making animations and poses for The Sims 4. Made in mind with Blender 3.0, but may work on versions 2.8 and above.

# How do I make a pose?
This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the basics of blender. It also assumes you have a pose already created and want to use the tool to export it.

The first time you use _s4animtools, it may look complicated. Here's a guide to help explain the basics!

Select the rig object, then fill out clip splits with the frame you want the pose to end on.
In clip name, enter the name of the pose you want to make. 

I'm calling my pose "a_thepancake1_lookingcoolpose"! Take note that the game will automatically add the actor name to the end of the clip name when you export it.
It will become "a_thepancake1_lookingcoolpose_x" after export.

Fill out the rig name with "x" as well.

Now, go to the top and click "New Export Clip".

This will create a folder named "Animation Workspace" on your desktop.

Open the folder, and you'll see your new clip files there!

Open Sims4Studio and create an empty package.

Open the game, and use Andrew's Pose Player and use Pose By Name to play your pose.

Enter the name you gave to your pose, plus the actor name you gave to your rig.

If you're not sure what it is, look at the clip name in S4S.

Ta-da! Hopefully it exported correctly. If it did, your sim should be using the pose you made now. Now that you've done that, let's move to more complex uses of this tool!
